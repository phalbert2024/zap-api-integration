# ZAP API Integration with AI Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains a project that integrates the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) API for automated vulnerability scanning into a web application. It also includes an AI analysis layer designed to classify and prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact. The project is designed to help users understand how to use ZAP for vulnerability scanning and how AI can enhance the analysis of the results.

## Key Components

### 1. ZAP API Integration

The project leverages the ZAP API to perform automated security scans. The ZAP API is used to:

- Start and manage vulnerability scans.
- Retrieve scan results.
- Handle the interaction between the application and the ZAP tool.

### 2. AI Analysis Layer

An AI analysis layer processes the scan results to:

- Classify vulnerabilities based on predefined rules.
- Prioritize issues according to their severity and potential impact.
- Provide insights that help users focus on the most critical vulnerabilities.

### 3. Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

/my-zap-api-project
├── /docs
│ ├── API_Documentation.md
│ ├── AI_Analysis_Explanation.md
│ └── Setup_Guide.md
├── /src
│ ├── routes.py
│ └── other_files.py
└── README.md

- **/docs**: Contains detailed documentation files.
  - `API_Documentation.md`: Describes the API endpoints and how to use them.
  - `AI_Analysis_Explanation.md`: Explains the AI analysis layer and how it processes scan results.
  - `Setup_Guide.md`: Provides a guide for setting up the project environment.

- **/src**: Contains the source code for the backend.
  - `routes.py`: Implements the Flask routes for interacting with the ZAP API and handling scan requests.
  - `other_files.py`: Includes additional code files needed for the backend.

### 4. How It Works

- **Initiate Scans:** Users can start vulnerability scans through the API by providing the target URL.
- **Retrieve Results:** Once a scan is complete, results can be fetched using specific API endpoints.
- **Analyze Results:** The AI analysis layer processes the scan results, classifies vulnerabilities, and prioritizes them based on severity.

## Documentation

For more information on how the ZAP API and AI analysis are implemented, refer to the documentation files in the `docs/` folder:

- [AI Analysis Explanation](docs/AI_Analysis_Explanation.md)
- [Setup Guide](docs/Setup_Guide.md)

## Understanding the Project

This project serves as an example of how to integrate vulnerability scanning tools with AI analysis to enhance security assessments. By understanding the provided documentation and code, users can learn about:

- How to interface with the ZAP API for security scanning.
- How to build an AI layer to interpret and prioritize security vulnerabilities.
- Best practices for organizing a project that combines these technologies.
